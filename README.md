# laser-monitor-regen
Monitoring software for self-built laser system. The package includes a MATLAB GUI for the REGEN amplifier. A 'sister' propgram for the ROD amplifier can be found [here](https://github.com/cpkm/laser-monitor-rodamp). Both are based off of the same general code with tweaks for the specific app. The software monitors the diode pump power (optical) as well as temperatures in the system.

A 'new' app can be created for a specific system by copying the regen (or rod) code and modifying as needed.
