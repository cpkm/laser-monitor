# laser-monitor
Monitoring software for self-built laser system. Includes MATLAB GUI's for both the REGEN and ROD amplifiers. Both are based off of the same general code with tweaks for the specific app. The software monitors the diode pump power (optical) as well as temperatures in the system.

A 'new' app can be created for a specific system by copying the regen (or rod) code and modifying as needed.
